<h2>Stock Price Prediction<br><br>
    "Stock Price Prediction using KNN Classification" is a project that utilizes the
K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to forecast the future prices of stocks. KNN is
a classification algorithm commonly used in machine learning for pattern recognition 
and regression tasks. In this project, historical stock data is analyzed and used to
train the KNN model, which then predicts future stock prices based on similar patterns 
observed in the past. This approach enables investors and traders to make informed 
decisions by anticipating potential price movements in the stock market.</h2>

<h2>Volume Controller using openCV<br><br>
"Volume Controller using OpenCV" is a project leveraging the capabilities of computer vision and
the OpenCV library in Python. By utilizing a webcam, the system detects and tracks hand gestures
in real-time. The user can control the volume of their PC by performing specific gestures recognized 
by the system, such as moving the hand up or down to increase or decrease the volume. Key technologies 
involved in this project include the OpenCV library for image processing and computer vision tasks, 
numpy for numerical computations, and Python as the programming language.</h2>
